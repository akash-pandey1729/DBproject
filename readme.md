The web application allows the Insurance providers to provide a premuium quote for an insurance product based on the health data provided by a curious potential customer.<br />
<br />
Once the user receives a quote, she can either generate a new quote for a different insurance product or the user can proceed with filling the form for buying the product.<br />
<br />
The data entered by the customer decides the quote. Also, while filling the form, those data already entered by the user during the inquiry is auto-filled and the user only has to fill the remaining data fields.
